# Learning Python

This repository documents my hands-on learning of Python fundamentals.
It contains small scripts, exercises, and experiments created through
regular practice as I build proficiency in the language.

## Goals
- Develop a strong foundation in Python syntax and core concepts
- Practice writing clear, readable, and well-structured code
- Build consistency through daily or near-daily coding practice
- Prepare for future standalone Python projects

## What You'll Find Here
- Short scripts focused on specific concepts
- Practice exercises and experiments
- Incremental improvements and refactors as understanding grows

## Repository Structure
Folders are organized by topic or practice area. Examples include:
- Basics (syntax, variables, conditionals, loops)
- Data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets)
- File handling
- Small exercises and experiments

## Notes
This repository is intentionally scoped to learning and experimentation.
Larger, polished projects will be created in separate repositories as my
skills develop.
